# Handwriting-Recognition-using-DNN
# Project Name: 
Handwriting Recognition using DNN
# Brief Description: 
In this project we will build a deep neural network that will recognize the handwritten text. we are going to use mnist dataset which has 60000        handwritten text samples. we will train our model and check accuracy and if accuracy is not up-to the mark then we will modify our CNN model.
